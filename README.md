STEP 1:  Calculate volume.
    volume = width*height*length
    
STEP 2: Determine if the package is bulky or heavy.
    is_bulky = volume >= 1000000 or width >= 150 or  height >= 150 or  length >= 150
    is_heavy = mass >= 20
    
STEP 3: Determine the category based on bulkiness and heaviness.


OUTPUT: I have tested with 3 different use cases.
